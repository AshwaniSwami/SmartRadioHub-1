Here's a prompt you can use for a Replit AI agent to help design the dashboard page for your NGO's content management platform:

Replit AI Agent Prompt: NGO Content Exploration Dashboard Design
Goal: Design a user-friendly and engaging dashboard page for a normal user of an NGO's content management platform. The primary purpose of this dashboard is to facilitate easy exploration and discovery of the NGO's diverse content.

Context:

Platform: Content Management System for an NGO.

User Type: General users/visitors to the platform.

Content Types: Articles, news updates, reports, success stories, events, videos, images, project descriptions, volunteer opportunities.

NGO Mission: Assume the NGO focuses on a positive social or environmental impact (e.g., education, sustainability, community development). The design should subtly reflect this.

Task: Generate a detailed description for the dashboard layout, key components, and user interaction flow.

Key Design Considerations:

Clarity & Simplicity: The layout should be clean, intuitive, and not overwhelming.

Discoverability: Users should easily find new, popular, and relevant content.

Engagement: Encourage users to click, explore further, and potentially engage with the NGO.

Responsiveness: Assume a design that would adapt well to various screen sizes (though specific breakpoints aren't needed in this initial prompt).

Dashboard Sections & Components to Include:

Header/Navigation Bar:

NGO Logo (prominent).

Main navigation links (e.g., Home/Dashboard, About Us, Projects, Get Involved, Contact).

Prominent Search Bar (for content).

Hero/Featured Content Section:

A prominent area to highlight 1-3 most important/latest pieces of content (e.g., a new campaign, a major report, a recent success story).

Should include a compelling image/video thumbnail, title, brief description, and a clear "Read More" or "View Details" call to action.

Content Discovery Sections (Below Hero):

"Latest Content" / "What's New": A scrollable or paginated list of recently published content, ideally with content cards showing a thumbnail, title, short excerpt, publication date, and category/tags.

"Popular Content" / "Trending Now": Show content that is currently receiving high engagement.

"Content Categories/Topics": A visual representation (e.g., card-based or tag cloud) allowing users to browse content by topic (e.g., "Education," "Health," "Environment," "Community," "Youth Programs"). Each category should link to a filtered content list.

"Explore by Content Type": Small, distinct sections or filters for specific content types (e.g., "Watch Our Videos," "Read Our Reports," "Upcoming Events").

Call to Action / Engagement Section (Optional but good):

A subtle prompt to "Donate," "Volunteer," or "Sign up for Newsletter," integrating visually with the NGO's mission.
