Analysis: The code changes replace the original registration endpoint implementation with a new implementation that includes database connection checks, improved error handling, and logging. However, the changes provided are for an express route handler (`app.post`) and not the register function defined in the original code. Based on the intention, I will replace the original register function with the provided express route handler, while adapting it to fit with the existing storage abstraction used in the original code.
