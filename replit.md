- **Episodes**: Individual radio episodes linked to projects with premium content support
- **Scripts**: Content scripts with rich text support, workflow status, and topic associations
- **Radio Stations**: External radio station entities with contact information and project access
- **Topics**: Tagging system for content categorization and script classification
- **Files**: Enhanced file storage with folder organization, versioning, and metadata
- **File Folders**: Hierarchical folder structure for organizing files within entities
- **Free Project Access**: Access control system for radio stations to specific projects
- **Themes**: Visual theme system for project categorization and organization

### File Management System
- **Enhanced File Organization**: Hierarchical folder structure with nested folders support
- **Multiple File Types**: Supports audio, video, documents, images with proper MIME type detection  
- **Entity-based Organization**: Files organized by projects, episodes, scripts, and radio stations

## Data Flow

### Content Creation Workflow
1. Users create Projects as organizational containers
2. Episodes are created within Projects with metadata
3. Scripts are authored with rich text content and linked to Projects
4. Files can be uploaded at Project, Episode, or Script levels
5. Radio Stations can be granted access to specific Projects

### API Data Flow
1. Frontend makes HTTP requests to `/api/*` endpoints
2. Express middleware handles request logging and error handling
3. Drizzle ORM executes type-safe database queries
4. Responses are formatted as JSON with appropriate HTTP status codes
5. React Query caches responses and manages state synchronization
