### API Data Flow
1. Frontend makes HTTP requests to `/api/*` endpoints
2. Express middleware handles request logging and error handling
3. Drizzle ORM executes type-safe database queries
4. Responses are formatted as JSON with appropriate HTTP status codes
5. React Query caches responses and manages state synchronization
